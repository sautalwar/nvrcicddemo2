# Secret Scanning Configuration
# This file helps prevent accidental commits of secrets to the repository

# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
# 1. NEVER hardcode secrets in source code
# 2. Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD workflows
# 3. Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets
# 4. Use environment variables for local development
# 5. Rotate secrets regularly (every 90 days minimum)

## Files that should NEVER be committed:
*.pem
*.key
*.p12
*.pfx
*.keystore
*.jks
**/secrets.json
**/credentials.json
**/*-credentials.json
**/*-secrets.json
workspace-ids.txt
azure-credentials.txt
.azure/
.credentials/

## Secret Patterns to Watch For:
# Azure Service Principal secrets
# AWS access keys
# API keys and tokens
# Database connection strings
# Private SSH keys
# TLS/SSL certificates

## Recommended Tools:
# - git-secrets: https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets
# - GitGuardian: https://www.gitguardian.com/
# - GitHub Secret Scanning: Enabled by default on public repos
# - TruffleHog: https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog

## If You Accidentally Commit a Secret:
# 1. IMMEDIATELY rotate the exposed secret
# 2. Remove it from Git history using BFG or git-filter-repo
# 3. Force push the cleaned history
# 4. Notify your security team
# 5. Review access logs for unauthorized usage

## Environment-Specific Secrets:
# Development: Use .env files (gitignored)
# Test/Staging: Use GitHub Environment Secrets
# Production: Use GitHub Environment Secrets + Azure Key Vault

## Contact:
# Security Team: security@company.com
# For secret rotation: Use scripts/set-github-secrets.ps1
